        <h2>Hi! I'm Lorena, I'm a software developer with 8+ years of experience working on games, Android and iOS apps, VR/AR, and interactive installations, mainly using Unity and C#.</h2>
        <p>My experience ranges from prototyping ideas and working on the core logic and gameplay programming, to doing the UI visual set up and animations by code, developing custom tools, handling integrations with backend APIs, implementing local network messaging for physical installations, and the less common applications of Unity outside of games. I love collaborating with people from different disciplines, and I'm a huge fan of game jams as a creative outlet in particular.<!--If I had to describe myself with a meme, I'd choose the poorly drawn character with a broom in one hand and a upraised fist yelling "Learn All The Things!"... and I'd combine it with the Socially Awkward Penguin for more accuracy.--></p>
        <h2>Where to find me</h2>

        <h2>The random facts</h2>
        <p>Outside of work I like to travel, watch too many tv-shows and movies, attend festivals (mainly ones with f: food, film, fantasy), explore nearby cities on the weekends, play DnD, and when the season is right, I love to ice-skate whenever possible (I used to play ice-hockey and really miss it).</p>
